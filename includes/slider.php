                      	<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s">The name comes from the Persian word, non, for bread. Unlike pita, naan has yogurt, milk, and sometimes eggs or butter in it, resulting in a softer texture. When the dough is made, bakers shape it into a ball and slap it on the interior walls of a tandoor, a clay oven. The bread puffs up and bubbles as it cooks.

                      	<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.8s">The multi-faceted nutrition and prevention powers of beans—a category that encompasses common beans (e.g., kidney, black, navy, pinto), chickpeas (garbanzo beans), soybeans, dried peas and lentils—make them an anti-aging dietary necessity. ...
